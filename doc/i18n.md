# Internationalization (I18n)

The portal is translated using [lit-localize](https://lit.dev/docs/localization/overview/). The texts of the base language (German) are contained in the source files. The other languages (currently only French) can be translated using a [XLIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF) file.

## Translation Workflow

Make sure to pull the latest changes:

```
git pull --rebase
```

Update the French translation file by extracting the German texts from the source files:

```
npm run locale:extract
```

The generated translation file [xliff/fr-CH.xlf](../xliff/fr-CH.xlf) can then be edited manually with a text editor or more conveniently with a XLIFF-compatible editor like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) (open source).

When all texts are translated, generate the locale artifacts:

```
npm run locale:build
```

Then commit & push the changes:

```
git commit -m 'Update french translations'
git push
```
